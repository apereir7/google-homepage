Originally I worked on this for a few hours apprx one month ago. Decided to get back to it a few days ago and actually put a decent effort into it. I was surprised with how intrigued I became with it. The more frustrated I became, the more determined I was to obatin the solution. It took me roughly three days with practically the entirty of each day. Opted to not use a seperate file for CSS, though I originally did. Reason being I didn't think I would use so much lines for CSS. 
What I learned:
  1) Basic CSS
  2) Basic html
  3) Google Web Dev was my best friend
  4) For questions I couldn't solve on my own, someone else already had a solution for after googling.
